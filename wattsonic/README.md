## Home Assistant Wattsonic GEN3 MODBUS integration

**Installation**:
1. edit configuration.yaml
include packages according to minimal/complete installation, check my [configuration.yaml](configuration.yaml)

2. copy wattsonic files
all files copy to your config dir (where is configuration.yaml)

	a) **minimal Wattsonic gen3** configuration
		start with this config. When your setup starts returning data, switch to latest configuration. minimal config has almost all sensors from modbus + 3 translated template sensor
		- copy just this older [wattsonic.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GiZMoSK1221/hass-addons/7c4f86199650526064935fac353a233ae6daa0ea/wattsonic/wattsonic.yaml) 
		

	b) **my latest gen3** configuration
		- copy [wattsonic_sql_postgre.yaml](wattsonic_sql_postgre.yaml) or [wattsonic_sql_mariadb.yaml](wattsonic_sql_mariadb.yaml) for sql sensors according to your db. Default HA is postgre
		- edit configuration.yaml and include corresponding db package
		- copy actual [wattsonic.yaml](wattsonic.yaml)
	
	this configuration consist of (but still does not has all registers):
	- almost all read modbus registers
	- switches for RW registers
	- can read Ecomode period 1,2 structure and has an example for writing structure
	- template sensors
		- Battery SOC ETA - time for charging/discharging battery
		- Grid Injection 15min - for Czech, grid injection in last 15minutes
		- Home Consumption Now and Today calculation
	- scripts for
		- setting economy/general/off grid mode
		- setting Grid Injection Power Limit Setting
	
	c) **GEN2** configuration
	as GEN2 has differrent registers, you cannot use my wattsonic.yaml.
	but, Ivan has made this basic one [wattsonic_gen2.yaml](wattsonic_gen2.yaml). enjoy and feel free to modify here on github

	d) **Sunways GEN2** configuration from Martin Kremla
		- based on my latest gen3 config
		- source is here in [sunways_gen2 directory](sunways_gen2)

4. edit modbus configuration in wattsonic.yaml
		 default is connection over serial and RS485. Change port according to your RS485 module. Slave adress is 247.
		 if you are running over TCP/IP, just delete serial config and uncomment tcp config. Slave adress is 255.

5. restart HASS
6. edit your lovelace dashboard, you can take mine [lovelace](lovelace.yaml) and just remove/use sensors
		- added [sunsynk config](sunsynk.yaml)
